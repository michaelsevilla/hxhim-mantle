% What is Mantle
Mantle~\cite{sevilla:sc15-mantle} is a great paper.

% What is HXHIM
%Problem: cloud key-value stores do perform well for tightly coupled and
%parallel supercomputers and large data sets. 
%- hpc: simulation data and structured (indexed in multiple dimensions)
%- petabytes of raw files
%- infiniband/RDMA instead of TCP, resource manager instead of daemons
%Existing: cloud kv-stores are diverse/unstructured
%- partitioned with consistenct hash
%Motivation:
%  - allows PLFS to materialize reads on compute cluster
%  - big data capabilities within an HPC environment; coordinates = key
%    - enhances locality, access rate, semantically meaningfulG
%
%Solution: MDHIM
%- HPC: infiniband, dynamic servers, pluggable DB, leverage resources, library
%- partitioned by range (not hash): # of spawned servers affects performance
%- cursor type operations and bulk ops: off-load query decision making to clients
%- multiple dimensions: users create secondary index instances
%
%Why does PLFS need a file system back end in the first place?
%How does ingest work if they are spawned at job start?

% Why do they make sense together?
% HXHIM has operations for:
% - adjusting the distribution of keys
% - builk inserations/retrievelas
