\section{Conclusion}

Load balancing is a well-known technique for alleviating load and improving
performance, yet finding the best policies for applications is still a
hands-on, tedious process. If a load balancing module were to be accepted into
a suite of services like the Mochi project, it must transcend domains and be
useful to a wide-range of applications. In this paper, we present the framework
for such a load balancing service which (1) helps administrators explore the
techniques for informing load balancing, (2) supports dynamic policies for
quickly changing workloads and higher level intelligence.  We demonstrate (1)
with a keyspace analysis for ParSplice and use our findings to design a load
balancing policy that improves resource utilization.  To drive the policy
engine designed in (2), we show that a single policy is inadequate and that
Mantle is flexible enough to explore policies generated with machine learning.
It is our hope that the introduction of the Mantle approach encourages the use
of machine learning and auto-tuning for policy design in future storage
systems.
