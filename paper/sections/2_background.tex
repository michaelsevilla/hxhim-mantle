\section{Background}

Mantle speeds up file systems by making metadata access faster, leveraging the
fact that file system metadata IO imposes small and frequent accesses on the
underlying storage system. It uses resource migration to load balance file
system metadata across a dedicated metadata cluster and 


Mantle~\cite{sevilla:sc15-mantle} is a programmable file system metadata
balancer implemented on the file system above Ceph (CephFS). 

system metadata IO does not scale like metadata IO~\cite{roselli:atec2000-FS-workloads}

% What is HXHIM
HXHIM is a key-value store designed for HPC architectures and multi-dimensional
data. 

% Why do they make sense together?
% HXHIM has operations for:
% - adjusting the distribution of keys
% - builk inserations/retrievelas
